* master (unreleased)

- The binding for ~magit-imerge-popup~ has been changed from 'I'
  within the merge popup to 'i' within ~magit-mode-map~.  With the
  current Magit (v2.90.1), this overrides the default binding for
  ~magit-gitignore-popup~, which is also bound to 'I'.

* 0.3.0

- The default binding for ~magit-imerge-popup~ within the merge popup
  has been changed from 'i' to 'I' to resolve a conflict with Magit's
  ~magit-merge-into~ (introduced in v2.12).
