Magit-imerge NEWS -- history of user-visible changes   -*- mode: org; -*-

* master (unreleased)

- Magit-imerge no longer binds ~magit-imerge~ in ~magit-mode-map~ or
  ~magit-dispatch~, leaving it up to the user to decide if and where
  to bind ~magit-imerge~.

  For those that would like to keep ~magit-imerge~ bound to "i" in
  ~magit-mode-map~, here's one suggestion for relocating
  ~magit-gitignore~:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (define-key magit-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-i") 'magit-gitignore)
  (define-key magit-mode-map "i" 'magit-imerge)
  #+end_src

* 1.1.0

Magit-imerge has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 3.0.0 or later.

- To be compatible with the latest Magit, popups have been rewritten
  as transient commands.

  The key bindings for options that started with '=' now start with
  '-' because, unlike magit-popup.el, transient.el doesn't require
  that options start with '='.

  ~magit-imerge-finish-popup~, which was bound to 'F' in
  ~magit-imerge-popup~, is now a suffix command
  (~magit-imerge-change-finish-arguments~) and bound to 'c' in the
  main ~magit-imerge~ transient.

* 1.0.0

- The binding for ~magit-imerge-popup~ has been changed from 'I'
  within the merge popup to 'i' within ~magit-mode-map~.  With the
  current Magit (v2.90.1), this overrides the default binding for
  ~magit-gitignore-popup~, which is also bound to 'I'.

* 0.3.0

- The default binding for ~magit-imerge-popup~ within the merge popup
  has been changed from 'i' to 'I' to resolve a conflict with Magit's
  ~magit-merge-into~ (introduced in v2.12).
